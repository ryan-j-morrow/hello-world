About Ryan J Morrow

# Bio
I'm **Ryan Morrow**, a rising junior at the *University of Iowa's Tippie College of Business*, double majoring in entrepreneurial management and business analytics and information systems. I'm passionate about problem-solving and strategy, with a goal of building a career in the consulting industry. I'm particularly drawn to cities like New York, Boston, Chicago, or Washington, DC. If consulting isn't in the cards, I see myself thriving in corporate strategy within the travel or consumer packaged goods industries.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I love giving back to the community by mentoring teenage entrepreneurs. Having started my own company at 16, I enjoy sharing my experience with young innovators. I'm also the diving coach for the Iowa City Diving Team, West High School, and City High School, where I lead practices and develop training programs for the team.

I'm driven by the idea of creating meaningful connections between brands and consumers, inspired by my own cherished memories with certain brands growing up. I want to be part of a team that works to deliver those same experiences to future generations. Erik Erikson, my favorite developmental psychologist, has influenced my thinking with his theories on identity and life stages, which resonate with my own journey of growth.

My commitment to excellence, both in and out of the classroom, fuels my ambition to become a leader in the business world.
